# Techniques

## Reconnaissance
- Determining OS versions using release dates.
  - Use the versions of installed software (looking at **release dates**) to determine a range of possible OS versions (correlating with **release dates**).

## Situational Awareness
- Examine recently edited files with `.viminfo`.
